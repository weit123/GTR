class NumberLineEnv(gym.Env):
    """
A custom Gym environment simulating a number line.

Actions:
    - 0: Move left (decrease the current position by 1, if greater than 0).
    - 1: Move right (increase the current position by 1, if less than max_position).

Observation:
    - An RGB image representation of the current and goal positions on the number line.
    - The image has a shape of (300, 300, 3) and pixel values ranging from 0 to 255.

Termination:
    - The episode ends when the current position reaches the goal position.

Reward:
    - A reward of 1 is given if the current position is the same as the goal position.
    - A reward of -1 is given if the action does not move the current position closer to the goal position.
    - A reward of 0 is given otherwise.

Initialization Options:
    - max_position: The maximum value on the number line (default is 5).
      Both the start and goal positions are randomly initialized between 0 and max_position.

Special Notes:
    - The start and goal positions are re-randomized at the beginning of each episode.
    - If after 2 * max_position steps the target still is not meet, the episode is terminated and the environment is reset.
    - The environment ensures that the start and goal positions are not the same initially.
    - An observation is returned as an RGB image with the current and goal positions labeled.
